# Main components

# Its main components:

-Microcontroller controls the operations and instructions given to the board;

-Clock is controlled by the oscillator crystal, usually 16 MHz, providing rhythm for the activities of microcontroller;

-Module defined by communication with a computer, made up of USB input,dedicated microcontroller and bridge for uploading 
 code to the arduino; 
 
- Power connector;
 
- Connectors for sensors that take analogue or digital readings.



# Physics

-Something to do with physics in order to link the items and realisation of their electronic functions with their main 
requirement of circuits divided in scales.

# Maths

-In maths with the numbers and quantities that are described to operate when activated.



# Programming Languages

-The most widely used programming languages are c and c++.They are similar in terms of how they are designed to Programming Languages

-The most widely used programming languages are c and c++. They are similar in terms of how they are designed to hold the at
arduino. 


# Online simulator

-One website recommend is tinkercad for simulating the arduino in operation.
